> 
The motivation behind this project is to use CRISP-DM methodology to carryout an analysis of the 2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survery Data analysis with the aim of uncovering answers to the following crucial questions:
* What is the programming language of choice?
* What's the pay for developers like?
* What is the framework of choice for developers?

Note that this questions are asked more specifically in relation to Data Scientist and Machine Learning Specialists survey respondents.
